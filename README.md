---

A [Paperclip](https://docs.paperclip.ing) plugin that tracks AI provider usage quotas and exposes real-time data to your agents and the dashboard. Agents can check remaining capacity *before* committing to an expensive call.

## Features

- **Dashboard widget** — current Claude usage (session, weekly, per-model) with color-coded bars
- **Full usage page** — detailed view with usage history
- **Agent tools** — `get-usage` and `get-usage-summary` so agents can self-throttle
- **Scheduled polling** — fetches usage every 15 minutes (configurable)
- **Auto-detection** — reads Claude OAuth tokens from `~/.claude` or the macOS Keychain
- **Reset times** — see when each quota window rolls over

## Supported providers

| Provider | Method |
|---|---|
| **Claude** (Anthropic) | OAuth usage API · CLI fallback |

More providers planned. Adding one? See [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Install

Install through your Paperclip instance's Plugin Manager UI, or via the REST API:

```http
# From npm
POST /api/plugins/install
Content-Type: application/json

{ "packageName": "paperclip-plugin-agent-usage" }
```

```http
# From a local path (development)
POST /api/plugins/install
Content-Type: application/json

{ "packageName": "/path/to/paperclip-plugin-agent-usage", "isLocalPath": true }
```

## Screenshots

### Detailed usage page

Per-model quota bars, reset times, and historical usage.

### Color-coded bars

Bars shift green → purple → red as usage approaches limits, so you spot trouble at a glance.

### Plugin settings

Auto-detects your Claude OAuth credentials and shows current connection status.

## Configuration

| Field | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `pollIntervalMinutes` | How often to refresh usage data | `15` |
| `providers` | Which providers to track | `["claude"]` |
| `claudeOAuthTokenRef` | A Claude Code OAuth token (`claude setup-token`), stored as a Paperclip secret. Checked first. | *(unset)* |
| `claudeConfigDir` | Absolute path to the Claude Code config directory holding `.credentials.json`. Leave blank to auto-detect. | `""` |
| `enableCliFallback` | Scrape `claude /usage` from the terminal when the usage API is unavailable | `true` |

OAuth credentials are auto-detected in this order: the `claudeOAuthTokenRef`
secret, the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, then your local
Claude install (`~/.claude`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, or macOS Keychain). Token
lifecycle is managed by Paperclip.

**If Paperclip runs the plugin worker in its own sandboxed process** (the
default when Paperclip itself manages the plugin, not just a bare Node
process) — the host does not pass its own environment through to plugin
workers, by design, so `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` being set on the Paperclip
host/container itself is invisible to the plugin no matter how it's
configured there. Set `claudeOAuthTokenRef` in this plugin's settings
instead — it uses Paperclip's own secret store, resolved by the host at
call time, and is the only mechanism that reaches the worker process under
that sandboxing model. Generate a token with `claude setup-token`, then
paste it into the secret picker for this field.

**If Paperclip runs as a different user than the one signed into Claude Code**
(and you're not using `claudeOAuthTokenRef`) — a service account, a
container, a systemd unit — file-based auto-detection looks in that user's
home directory and finds nothing. Set `claudeConfigDir` to the signed-in
user's `~/.claude` (for example `/home/alice/.claude`) and make sure
the Paperclip process can read it.

The CLI fallback drives Claude Code's interactive terminal UI, so it only works
when the user running Paperclip has completed Claude Code's first-run setup
(theme picker, folder trust, sign-in). If it hasn't, the plugin reports which
step is blocking rather than hanging. Set `enableCliFallback` to `false` to skip
the fallback entirely and surface the credential or API error directly.

## Agent tools

### `get-usage`

Returns raw quota data (JSON) for a provider. Use this when an agent needs to decide whether to proceed with an expensive operation — call it first, branch on the result.

### `get-usage-summary`

Returns a human-readable summary of remaining capacity across all configured providers, including reset times. Good for narrative responses ("you have 47% of your weekly quota left, resetting in 2 days").

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # esbuild watch
npm run build        # bundle to dist/
npm run typecheck
```

Releases are managed by [shipx](https://github.com/lacymorrow/shipx):

```bash
npm run release           # interactive
npm run release:beta      # pre-release with --tag beta
```
